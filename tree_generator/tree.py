# Requirements:
# This script requires Ghostscript for image conversion
# You have to install the python package (via pip):
# $ pip3 install Ghostscript
# And you have to Download and install Ghostscript binaries for your OS:
# https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html
# Lastly, add ghostscript install directory bin folder to PATH environment variable
# On windows, for example, your ghostscript install directory bin folder might be:
#   C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.52
# Add that line to the path environment variable
# You may have to reboot for the path environment variable to take effect
